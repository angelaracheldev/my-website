        <p>Hi, I&#39;m Angela — a developer who enjoys building things and thinking through problems.<br/><br/>

      I&#39;m currently on a break, which gave me the perfect excuse to finally build this site. When I&#39;m not coding, I cook, explore, and get lost online and off.
      <br/><br/>
My background is in backend development, but I&#39;ve been diving into frontend and getting curious about DevOps. I&#39;m working toward becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer.
<br/><br/>
This site is more than a portfolio — it&#39;s a space to share my growth, experiments, and ideas. I&#39;m also open to opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and build something meaningful.
