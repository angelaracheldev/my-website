This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## The main branch of this repository is automatically built and deployed using AWS services:

1. AWS CodePipeline detects changes pushed to the main branch.

2. It triggers AWS CodeBuild to run the build process, compiling the project and preparing assets.

3. Once the build succeeds, the output is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket configured to serve as a static website.

4. The site is then live and accessible at: [angelarachel.dev](angelarachel.dev)

## This automated pipeline ensures that every update to the main branch is quickly and reliably deployed to the live site without manual intervention.
